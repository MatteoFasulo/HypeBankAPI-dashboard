# 🌟 HypeAPI

Unofficial Python module for interacting with the HYPE card API.

## 📝 Notes
- HYPE only allows the use of one device at a time. Logging in with this module will disconnect you from the application and vice versa.

## 🐳 Docker
`start.sh` will run the python script and then build the image with all the data generated:
```sh
./start.sh
docker run -p 8501:8501 hype_dashboard
```
Then visit [http://127.0.0.1:8501](http://127.0.0.1:8501) to view the Streamlit app!

## 🚀 Standalone
Run:
```python
git clone https://github.com/MatteoFasulo/HypeBankAPI-dashboard
```
The `main.py` script supports argparse for command line arguments:
```python
python main.py -m EMAIL -b BIRTHDATE [-l LIMIT] [-v]
```
The script is invoked using the following command-line arguments:
- `-m EMAIL`, `--email EMAIL`: Specifies the email address. It is a required argument.
- `-b BIRTHDATE`, `--birthdate BIRTHDATE`: Specifies the birth date. It is a required argument.
- `-l LIMIT`, `--limit LIMIT`: Limit the number of transactions to fetch from Hype API. Default to 50. It is an optional argument.
- `-v`, `--verbose`: Enables verbose output. It is an optional flag argument.
>Tip: If you encountered an error while running the command try `python3 main.py`

In order to run the Streamlit app, you need to run `main.py` and then execute:
```python
streamlit run Home.py --server.port=8501 --server.address=127.0.0.1
```
> 📄 Home.py is the main Streamlit page. The WebApp has multiple pages inside the `pages` folder!
